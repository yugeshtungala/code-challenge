Step 7: Task 6 - Answer React and TypeScript Questions
Answer the following questions as part of your documentation or commit messages:

Question 7: Explain the use of the useEffect hook.

The useEffect hook is used to perform side effects in functional components. It runs after the initial render and can also run after state or props changes if dependencies are specified.
Question 8: What is a High-Order Component (HOC)?

A High-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or logic.
Question 9: Use cases for a HOC.

HOCs are useful for reusing component logic, adding authentication checks, enhancing components with additional functionality, or injecting props.
Question 10: What does it indicate when a component is prefixed with use?

Components prefixed with use are likely custom hooks, indicating that they manage state or perform side effects.
Question 11: What is a Generic type in TypeScript?

A Generic type in TypeScript allows the user to define a function, class, or interface that can work with any type, providing type safety without sacrificing flexibility.
Question 12: Difference between controlled and uncontrolled inputs in React.

Controlled inputs are bound to component state and are updated by React. Uncontrolled inputs store their value in the DOM, and React doesn't manage their state.
